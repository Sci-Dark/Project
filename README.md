Hey @bignye14, click this link to learn how to make branches and create pull requests. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
Once you have created a new branch, add a new file and title it "person.java". make a new class using the term:

public class person {

}

and add a string variable called name like this:

String name;

make sure it is empty, and if you have done everything right, and committed these changes, go to the 'Pull requests" tab and make a pull request using the link from above. Once you have made the pull request, and you are ready, notify me in person and i will tell you through chat if you passed or not. If so, you get that reward, if not, you dont :)

good luck B)
